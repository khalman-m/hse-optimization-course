    Solves system Ax=b using Conjugate Gradients method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matvec : function
        Implement matrix-vector product of matrix A and arbitrary vector x
    b : 1-dimensional np.array
        Vector b for the system.
    x_0 : 1-dimensional np.array
        Starting point of the algorithm
    tolerance : float
        Epsilon value for stopping criterion.
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations.
    trace : bool
        If True, the progress information is appended into history dictionary during training.
        Otherwise None is returned instead of history.
    display:  bool
        If True, debug information is displayed during optimization.
